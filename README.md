# Prioritizing farm management interventions to improve climate change adaptation and mitigation outcomes - testing assumptions and digging deep on model structures

This repository contains R code and resources for conducting a deeper assessment of farm management interventions for climate change adaptation and mitigation in banana plantations. The work is inspired by [Fernandez et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00809-0) "Prioritizing farm management interventions to improve climate change adaptation and mitigation outcomes—a case study for banana plantations." https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-022-00809-0

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to further investigate and analyze the effectiveness of various farm management interventions in mitigating and adapting to climate change in banana plantations. We aim to expand upon the methodology outlined in the referenced paper by implementing Monte Carlo simulations to assess the uncertainty associated with the most promising decision options.

## What's Included

- **R Code**: This repository includes R scripts for conducting Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of promising farm management interventions.
- **Data**: Input data files are included for running the models.
- **Documentation**: Code will be annotated to explain the code implementation and interpretation of results.

## Methodology

Our approach will involve adapting the decision analysis framework outlined in [Fernandez et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00809-0). We will use R programming language to develop Monte Carlo simulations, allowing us to model the uncertainty associated with each intervention's impact on climate change adaptation and mitigation outcomes.
